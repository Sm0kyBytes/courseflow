# An Express Server Template

## Project Overview

This project is a boilerplate for creating a server using **Express** in **JavaScript**, designed to simulate a model similar to Quora Web. It includes an API to connect to a **PostgreSQL** database according to the software requirements.

  [See API document here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HNXI7pJd4xmmO4_hXNUZe94GA0ikWnWEZQjwgVdLUq8/edit?usp=sharing)

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
	```bash 
	npm install
	```
3. **Create your SQL database**:
Set up a PostgreSQL database. You can use tools like `psql`, `pgAdmin`, or any other PostgreSQL client.

4. **Mock data in your database**:
Populate your database with mock data to test the API. You can use SQL scripts or tools like `pgAdmin` to insert data.
 [This project uses this simulation data.](https://gist.github.com/napatwongchr/811ef7071003602b94482b3d8c0f32e0)

6. **Configure the database connection**:
- Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory.
-  Add your database configuration to the `.env` file:
```markfile
  DB_NAME=<your_database_name>
  DB_PASSWORD=<your_database_password>
  ```

7. **Start the project**:
```bash
npm run start
```
## Usage Guide

This project serves as an example to study API development and database connectivity. It demonstrates how to:

-   Build a RESTful API with Express.
-   Connect to a PostgreSQL database.
-   Perform basic database operations.

Feel free to explore the codebase, modify the routes, and experiment with different database queries to suit your needs.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
